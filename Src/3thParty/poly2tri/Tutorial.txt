Since there are no Input validation of the data given for triangulation you need to think about this. Poly2Tri does not support repeat points within epsilon.

If you have a cyclic function that generates random points make sure you don't add the same coordinate twice.
If you are given input and aren't sure same point exist twice you need to check for this yourself.
Only simple polygons are supported. You may add holes or interior Steiner points
Interior holes must not touch other holes, nor touch the polyline boundary
Use the library in this order:
Initialize CDT with a simple polyline (this defines the constrained edges)
Add holes if necessary (also simple polylines)
Add Steiner points
Triangulate
